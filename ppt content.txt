The primary objective of this data science project is to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning techniques, and Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform sentiment analysis on user reviews. In addition, it aims to deliver customized hotel suggestions, taking into account a user's intended purpose of visit and specific requirements. This automated system for sentiment analysis and hotel recommendations will provide valuable insights to luxury hotels by allowing them to identify areas for improvement and areas of excellence within their services.
